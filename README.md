The problem has been taken from edabit (https://edabit.com/). Create a function that returns True if given inequality expression is correct and False otherwise. 

Example: correct_signs("3 < 7 < 11") ➞ True

correct_signs("13 > 44 > 33 > 1") ➞ False

correct_signs("1 < 2 < 6 < 9 > 3") ➞ True

Note: This problem can easily be solved using eval(), however avoid using the function for security purpose. We will solve the problem using regex
