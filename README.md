A program that applies filters to BMPs
Functions implemented in helpers.c are such that a user can apply grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to their images. <br/>
The function grayscale takes an image and turns it into a black-and-white version of the same image. <br/>
The function sepia takes an image and turns it into a sepia version of the same image. <br/>
The reflect function takes an image and reflects it horizontally. <br/>
Finally, the blur function takes an image and turns it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
