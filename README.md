Implement a Java program to calculate the waiting time and turnaround time involving N processes using Round-Robin scheduling algorithm. The user should be allowed to enter the following information: <br/>
•	N, or the total of processes involved (N should be between 4 to 10 inclusive)  <br/>
•	Burst time for each process  <br/>
•	The quantum time to be used by the RR algorithm.  <br/>

Arrival time is not needed as it is assumed all processes arrived at the same time (t=0). Using the information provided, calculate  <br/>
•	Waiting times for all the processes  <br/>
•	Turnaround times for all the processes  <br/>
•	The average waiting time produced by the RR algorithm for the given situation/problem.  <br/>
